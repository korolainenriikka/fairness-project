# Analysis

- do intersections of sensitive groups (immigrant young female etc)
- measure group fairness of all combinations and inspect
- leave one out cross validate to get test prediction (bc the dataset is small)
- age split: +- 25 years. reason for this choice: german law sees under 25 year olds as youth in some parts of law
