abstract = {Abstract This article describes the robot Stanley, which won the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge. Stanley was developed for high-speed desert driving without manual intervention. The robot's software system relied predominately on state-of-the-art artificial intelligence technologies, such as machine learning and probabilistic reasoning. This paper describes the major components of this architecture, and discusses the results of the Grand Challenge race. Â© 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},
